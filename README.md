# Systems-Software-Engineering-ML

As part of the Systems and Software Engineering I lecture (by Prof. Dr. Ramesh) at Goethe University, we worked on 3 projects with Machine Learning components, with this repository containing the content of the Machine Learning group that supported the other 3 project groups.

## The 3 projects:
1. [Spotify Group Recommendation:](https://github.com/danielcopper/spotify-group-recommendation) A website where Spotify members can join together to get a playlist tailored to their music taste that everyone is happy with.

2. [Smart Cook:](https://github.com/CarloStock/SmartCook) An app that suggests food recipes based on photos.

3. [News Summarizer:](https://github.com/Ansothso/News-Summeraizer) A web-based application for text summarization that shows summarized news from The Guardian and BBC. The summaries are generated using OpenAI's GPT-3 Davinci model.

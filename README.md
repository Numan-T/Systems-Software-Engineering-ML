# Systems-Software-Engineering-ML

As part of the Systems and Software Engineering I lecture (by Prof. Dr. Ramesh) at Goethe University, we worked on 3 projects with Machine Learning components, with this repository containing the content of the Machine Learning group that supported the other 3 project groups.

## The 3 projects:
1. [Spotify Group Recommendation:](https://github.com/danielcopper/spotify-group-recommendation) A website where Spotify members can join together to get a playlist tailored to their music taste that everyone is happy with. The Playlists are generated by a self created graph model.

2. [Smart Cook:](https://github.com/CarloStock/SmartCook) An app that suggests food recipes based on photos of food ingredients. The ingredients are recognized by a faster RCNN model.

3. [News Summarizer:](https://github.com/Ansothso/News-Summeraizer) A web-based application for text summarization that shows summarized news from The Guardian and BBC. The summaries are generated using OpenAI's GPT-3 Davinci model.

## Installation & Usage:
### Spotify Group Recommendation - Graph Solution
1. <ins>Set up your access to the Spotify API</ins>: Navigate to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/). Create a (free) Spotify developer account. Create an App in the dashboard. Go to the settings for this app and add "http://localhost:8888/callback" as redirect URI. Also get your client_id & client_credentials here and save them in the code files "client_id.txt" / "client_credentials.txt".
2. <ins>Install requirements</ins>: It is recommended to create a virtual environment and install then required packages via the command "pip install -r requirements.txt".
3. <ins>Run ml_main.py</ins>. You can also specify the playlist size in this file.
